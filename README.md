##WHY I AM SHARING
This is a project I did in the second year of my degree program. It has been living on my laptop since then, ashamed, I have decided to share it with the community. The project was done in Android programming language, new developers can learn the following concepts by look into the code:
* Android app connect to MYSQL DB
* Populate android spinners by fetching data from remote DB
* Android Async background processes
* Android Basic Map Google V2 (You should switch to latest Google Maps API)
* Android Web View
* Actually you will learn quite alot ;)
